<p><strong>Membership Dues:</strong></p>
<p>Adult membership dues are currently $80 per month (including taxes). This membership covers participation in all of our practices, including family participation in any of our family practice sessions. In addition to monthly dues, we also value from our members a commitment to regular practice and a small amount of additional support such as through helping with cleaning or administrative tasks. Organizing and teaching is done on a volunteer basis by members. We are a community-based, not for profit practice group with the intention of keeping our training widely accessible. If you are interested in participating but dues would create a financial burden, please get in touch.</p>
<p>You can begin practicing with us at any time. Please write to us at <strong>SeattleKokikaiAikido@gmail.com</strong> to schedule a time to watch or participate as our guest.</p>
